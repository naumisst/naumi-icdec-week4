Analog Circuit Design Repository
Design and Implementation of Inverter, Oscillator, and Op-Amp

ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This repository contains the design and implementation of three essential analog circuits: inverter, oscillator, and op-amp. Each folder includes schematics, layouts created with Magic VLSI, and LVS files to verify the consistency between the schematic and layout. Additional documentation is also provided to support further understanding and development.

ðŸ›  Project Structure
inverter/
Contains the schematic, layout, testbench, and LVS results.
oscillator/
Contains the schematic, layout, testbench, and LVS results.
documentation/
Includes images of the schematics, layouts, and matching LVS results for the inverter and oscillator circuits.
opamp/
Contains the schematic, layout, LVS results, and documentation for the op-amp.

ðŸš€ Installation and Usage
Ensure that Magic VLSI and appropriate software for schematic simulation, such as SPICE or other EDA tools, are installed. Open the schematic or layout files in each folder to begin analysis and design verification.
